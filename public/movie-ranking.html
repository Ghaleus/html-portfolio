<h1>The Best Movies According to David</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>

<p>
    Spirited Away became an instant favorite from the first time I saw it in the
    mid 2000s. Its animation is beautiful, the story is simple yet poignant, and
    the incorporation of Japanese folklore elements, both real and original,
    appeal to the myth loving side of me. It is easily the best anime film I've
    seen (though many of Miyazaki's films rank high on my list).

<h3>Mary Poppins</h3>

<p>
    This is a movie that I truly believe is a 10/10 perfect movie. The creativity,
    filmography, acting, music, story, special effects, all work in harmony to
    create a movie that needs nothing added and nothing removed or changed. It is
    my favorite live action Disney movie and probably my favorite Julie Andrews
    movie as well.

<h3>Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>

<p>
    This is a tough one because I have many favorite movies and wasn't sure which
    to put. The decision came down to how often I actually find myself thinking of
    the LOTR and when I do this movie is what I visualize. Watching not only the
    Extended Editions, but also the commentary and behind the scenese on how they
    made this classic fantasy movie gives me chills each time. It's infinitely
    quoatable (as are most of my favorite movies) and holds up in visuals even
    now. It defined a genre, reinvigorated fantasy movies as actual money makers
    and has lasted over 20 years and still one of the big contenders in modern
    film history.
